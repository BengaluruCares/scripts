# Scripts for bengalurucares.in

## Requirements
- [deno](https://deno.land)
  - Required for scripting. Thus, OPTIONAL if you don't
    don't want to run/write scripts.

All the scripts are written in Typescript using [deno](https://deno.land) instead
of `nodejs`. There is not much of a difference between the two,
if you are familiar to `js` or `ts` and [ES6 module system](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/08/es6-in-depth-modules/),
`deno` will feel like home :wink:
